"""
We need to write tests to ensure that our code works as expected.

A unit test is a way of testing a unit
        -the smallest piece of code that can be logically isolated in a system
        (a function, a method, or property)

Tests should be separated from the actual code in a folder called "tests"

Each test file should be named "test<file_name>" where filename is the name of the file it is testing

Each test function or class should begin with "test" or "Test"
